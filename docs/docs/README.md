# Hugger

Corona is finally relatively over, so let's start hugging again!
Hugger is a simple way to add hugs to your minecraft server. It has an [extensive wiki](https://hugger-wiki.pages.dev), simple commands, [poop code](https://github.com/Er3/Hugger) and [lots of hugs](https://hugger-wiki.pages.dev/assets/icon.png)!

If you want information about installation and setup, head over to [Getting Started](/Getting_Started).

## About the wiki

The wiki is deployed to `hugger-wiki.pages.dev` with the help of [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
It uses [Mkdocs with the material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

To navigate pages you use the sidebar. You can find the table of contents on the right.
If you want to search you can use the searchbar on top of the page.

Found an issue with the wiki, or any other part of Hugger? Please [report it on GitHub](https://github.com/Erb3/Hugger/issues) so that I can fix it.
