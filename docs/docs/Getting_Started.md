# Getting started

Want to get started with Hugger, but don't know how? Here is a guide.

If you know how to do some parts feel free to skip around with the Table of Contents on the right side of your screen.

## Requirements

To use Hugger you **need** the following:

- Spigot / Bukkit based server (Recommend using [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/))
- Admin access to the server
    * Ability to add plugins
    * Ability to modify configuration files


For some optional extra features you need:

* [PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI) (For PlaceholderAPI support)
* Permission manager (For giving people access to commands)

## Installing

Installing depends a bit on how your server is set up. If you have GUI (Graphical User Interface) where you manager your server, please follow "Installing with a GUI". If not please follow "Installing without a GUI".

### Installing with a GUI

There are three main scenarios when installing with a GUI.

1. You do not have a menu to add/remove plugins
2. Hugger is not in the catalogue
3. Hugger is in the catalogue

#### Scenario 1: You do not have a menu to add/remove plugins

If you do not have a menu to add or remove plugins, please continue to the section about installing without a GUI.

#### Scenario 2: Hugger is not in the catalogue

If you have an interface for managing plugins, but Hugger is not in it's cataloge, you can either ask the administratior to add Hugger, or follow the section on "Installing without a GUI".

#### Scenario 3: Hugger is in the catalogue

If you have an interface for managing plugins, and Hugger is in the cataloge, just install it!

#### Scenario 4: None of the above

If you have a GUI, but none of the above applies, please continue to the section about installing without a GUI.

### Installing without a GUI

If you don't have a simple GUI to manage plugins, you should install Hugger manually by uploading the .jar.
This proccess is different from host to host.
You should start by getting the latest .jar from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/hugger) or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Erb3/Hugger/releases).
From here I can't help you more than saying that you should upload this .jar into your `/plugins` folder.

## Configuring

So, you have gotten Hugger installed! Congrats.
If you haven't already, please restart your server for Hugger to be loaded.
After this you might want to edit configuration, unless you like the default one.

To edit the config, start by opening the file. All options in the file are documented in the article about config options.
